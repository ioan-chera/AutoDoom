========================================
Changes by Ioan Chera in Eternity Engine
========================================
Dates are in dd.mm.yyyy format. Most recent update is first.

========================
Since v4.00.00 "Völuspá"
========================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
25.07.2020

BUGFIX: Fixed HOM happening when trying to render same portal from two separate
        windows.

IMPROVEMENT: Self-tagging Portal_Define flipped-anchor visual portals are now 
        possible, though there'll be no mirror.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19.07.2020

IMPROVEMENT: Thing_Destroy now works like in GZDoom, unless level is vanilla
             Hexen (where it will still support arg 3). Most notably, arg 2 is
             now "flags" and 1 means "extreme death".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19.06.2020

IMPROVEMENT: Plane portals can now render sloped visplanes, with the slope
             copied from the source sector. Note that horizon portals still lack
             this feature, due to how they were designed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13.06.2020

BUGFIX: Fixed the FLIES thingtype particlefx from sounding badly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
25.05.2020

BUGFIX: Fixed an occasional crash happening when starting maps with things with
        negative doomednums.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.05.2020

BUGFIX: Odd-duration frames now restore correctly when returning to nightmare
        mode to normal.

        Fixed the CLIPMIDTEX linedef flag not working over portals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
26.04.2020

FEATURE: New console command: warp, which, like in ZDoom, teleports player to
         given coordinates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
23.04.2020

BUGFIX: Fixed the ChangeSkill linedef special acting completely wrong when
        called from ACS, and crashing when such a script is triggered from the
        console.
        
        Fixed a crash happening when entering a sector with an invalid colormap
        specified in the UDMF editor or ExtraData.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.04.2020

FEATURE: Added the offset(,) Decorate state specifier which exists in ZDoom and
         is used to set the misc1 and misc2 flags, which are also capable of
         setting weapon coordinates.
         
         Eternity is also capable of interpolation when using offset(). By
         default it's disabled, but you can enable it by using the "interpolate"
         specifier as a third argument, for example: offset(1, 32, interpolate).
         When inheriting via the Decorate syntax and reapplying offset(),
         interpolation will be disabled again unless you specify it again.
         
         For the standard "frame" EDF section, you can use the +|-interpolate 
         specifier to add or remove the flag.

         Added the DOOMWEAPONOFFSET gameproperties flag which is already enabled
         for DOOM (solely for Dehacked and past EDF mod compatibility) and
         enables the less intuitive DOOM rule on when offsets have effect.
         Otherwise the better Hexen rule applies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
27.03.2020

IMPROVEMENT: Added damagefactor.remove and cleardamagefactors to thingtype and
             thingdelta to be able to remove them from the list.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
24.03.2020

IMPROVEMENT: Now ExtraData mapthings also support names in the "special" field,
             just like linedefs. It was badly missing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22.03.2020

BUGFIX: Fixed the "ignoreskill" flag of "ammoeffect" not working as advertised.

BUGFIX: Fixed 1-sided linedef wall portals showing HOM if their middle texture
        isn't set.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21.03.2020

BUGFIX: Fixed a sky rendering HOM happening in maps like Sargasso level 2 and
        any place where both floor and ceiling of a zero-height sector have
        F_SKY1 and it's expected to see a sky wall. Eternity would show HOM,
        whereas both Chocolate-Doom and PrBoom would render the sky properly.

BUGFIX: Fixed EDF thingtype translation 14 (white) not having any effect.

BUGFIX: Fixed buggy rendering of masked middle textures when mixing sector
        colormaps with player invulnerability or light amplification.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21.02.2020

FEATURE: Now the TINTTAB Heretic lump works as a BOOM-like translucency map for
         the ghost effect.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08.02.2020

FEATURE: New weapon flag PHOENIXRESET, which implements the hacky Heretic way of
         resetting the Phoenix Rod from the powered state. Its drawback is that
         sometimes it can consume more ammo than intended. You can still use
         FORCETOREADY as a more general-purpose counterpart.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
01.11.2019

IMPROVEMENT: Jumping is now a compatibility setting. By default it's disabled.
             If player attempts to jump anyway, a message will be shown that it
             needs to be explicitly enabled in settings.

             EDF player classes now support an "+AlwaysJump" option, which will
             enable jumping regardless of compatibility setting or EMAPINFO
             disable-jump. Also, setting "speedjump" to 0 will completely
             disable jumping for that class.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
28.10.2019

FEATURE: Now playerclass has two new fields: maxhealth (default 100) and
         superhealth (default = maxhealth). They're needed for some built-in
         effects, mainly the HealThing special and the powered A_GauntletAttack.

         Also updated the EDF healtheffect items to use the new @maxhealth and
         @superhealth keywords instead of absolute values to refer to the
         current playerclass values. They're safely replaceable by Dehacked and
         healthdelta structures.

FEATURE: New optional "jump" ("dsjump") player skin sound, as needed by some
         skin mods.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
27.10.2019

BUGFIX: Stop HealThing from attempting to heal dead bodies. Crazy stuff would
        happen, such as the view getting garbled and Eternity crashing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
26.10.2019

BUGFIX: For macOS, fixed the failure to start Eternity from Terminal if its
        locale was set to non-English settings. This may apply to other
        UNIX-like systems too.

Feature: Finally added support for Dehacked "Monsters Infight" misc setting.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
23.10.2019

FEATURE: Added the Generic_Stairs special. Needed for proper support of BOOM ge-
         neralized stairs, which the current parameterized specials aren't
         capable of.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22.09.2019

BUGFIX: If there are multiple textures with the same name in TEXTURE1+TEXTURE2,
        the first one should be loaded, not the last. This fixes mods such as
        Army of Darkness DOOM, which looked wrong in Eternity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
23.07.2019

BUGFIX: Fixed EDF thingtype droptype to actually remove inherited object's item.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22.06.2019

FEATURE: Added CPXF_ANCESTOR to CheckProximity.

IMPROVEMENT: You can now use level lump names with -warp at the command line.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20.06.2019

BUGFIX: Fixed ACS function CheckProximity failing to work when counting players.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
31.03.2019

BUGFIX: Fixed a serious crash happening when having 3D clipping on, going first
        to a map with linked portals, then going to a map without portals. The
        crash would occur randomly and not always.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21.03.2019

BUGFIX: Fixed a crash happening when seeing for the first time progressively
        larger swirling textures.

        Fixed a crash happening when loading a game with alpha-cycling sprites.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18.03.2019

FEATURE: Added the Generic_Lift special, which ZDoom had added, because there
         are a few Boom generalized specials which can't be represented by other
         parameterized lift specials.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
09.03.2019

BUGFIX: Fixed PointPush_SetForce not using argument for magnitude when tagging
        sectors.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
24.02.2019

FEATURE: Added UDMF linedef "monstershoot" boolean field. Needed because the
         ill-named "impact" field only allows players to shoot the linedef.
         This one allows monsters too. The ones who wrote the original UDMF
         specs must have been unaware that vanilla Doom has some specials
         (such as GR: Open Door) which are triggerable by both monsters and
         players, while others (the rising platforms) only by players.

         Added UDMF sector "phasedlight", "lightsequence" and "lightseqalt"
         boolean fields, because ExtraData supports adding them individually,
         without resorting to the "special" field.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
23.02.2019

BUGFIX: The scrolling sky scrolling speed, changeable through ACS, wasn't stored
        in save games.

IMPROVEMENT: EMAPINFO skyDelta and sky2Delta now accept fractional values. It
             was appropriate to add this because an ACS function already
             supports fixed-point for changing these states.

             Currently legacy Hexen MAPINFO doesn't have it however.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22.02.2019

BUGFIX: Fixed a crash happening with sub-unit linedef length maps (made in UDMF).
        Now the slime-trail reduction function uses floating-point.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13.02.2019

BUGFIX: Fixed a crash happening with slopes having MBF-transferred skies.

        Fixed wrong drawing of animated textures on slopes when the textures are
        of different sizes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
09.02.2019

BUGFIX: Fixed a memory leak where things with alphavelocity would never be
        deallocated and gradually slow the game to a crawl.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07.02.2019

IMPROVEMENT: Masked textures (such as mid-grates) can now be applied on portal
             overlays. They can even use the SMMU rippling animation (unlike the
             2-sided linedef midtextures).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
27.01.2019

FEATURE: F_SKY1 now when applied on middle textures has the same effect as floor
         and ceiling skies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
25.01.2019

FEATURE: Added some UDMF-exclusive fields to ExtraData: linedef portalid and 
         sector portalid.floor and portalid.ceiling, so that Portal_Define 
         doesn't require UDMF any longer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22.01.2019

FEATURE: Added a "game.itemheight" property to EDF game properties which
         overrides item pickup height, which is set to 8 in Doom/Strife and to
         32 in Heretic/Hexen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20.01.2019

BUGFIX: Fixed the wrong drawing of Heretic weapons when no status bar is drawn.
        Added a "fullscreenoffset" floating-point field in weaponinfo for that,
        because Heretic weapons have different hardcoded offsets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12.01.2019

BUGFIX: Fixed polyobject doors which rotate more than 180 degrees from
        malfunctioning when blocked by things when closing.

IMPROVEMENT: Scrolling texture movement (including attached 3dmidtex) is now
             interpolated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
25.12.2018

IMPROVEMENT: Chasecam and walkcam are now portal-aware. Interpolation is however
             disabled.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
25.11.2018

IMPROVEMENT: Now if an action is bound to more than one key, and two of the keys
             are being pressed, releasing just one of them will not stop the
             action. You need to release all of them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19.11.2018

IMPROVEMENT: Changed how floating objects move in relation to portal
             polyobjects. They no longer remain fixed relative to the inner
             chamber sectors, but are shifted in the opposite direction, so they
             appear as remaining fixed relative to the main world. This
             behaviour is more consistent with how thing movement isn't
             influenced by traditional vertically moving sectors, and more
             stable as well than just adapting velocity when passing the portal.
             It also avoids unrealistic direction changes when the containing
             polyobject changes movement.

             Polyobject portals now show in the map as part of the main area,
             because indeed they rarely ever overlap anything vertically.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17.11.2018

BUGFIX: Interpolate the walkcam while the game is paused. Previously it would
        only interpolate while the game was running, but the walkcam is one of
        the few cameras controllable even while the game is paused.

        Fixed a bug where the walkcam would move a bit backwards when opening
        the console.

        Fixed objects standing on the outer edges of portal polyobjects not up-
        dating their floor reference Z, thus floating above ground when the
        polyobject is gone from below them.

IMPROVEMENT: Console movement is now interpolated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13.11.2018

BUGFIX: Fixed edge-case situations where line portal teleportation would fail,
        such as when sliding really slowly along a wall, or almost parallel to
        one.

        Also fixed several cases where portal interpolation would fail display-
        ing correctly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
05.07.2018

BUGFIX: Fixed a problem where particles appeared in the wrong place, because of
        nearby portals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
29.06.2018

IMPROVEMENT: Movement through portals is finally interpolated. No more hops or
             slight discontinuities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
27.06.2018

BUGFIX: Fixed a situation where linedefs would still block despite being in
        different portal layers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20.06.2018

BUGFIX: Fixed a rare glitch, which would sometimes even crash the macOS-based
        launcher app, due to malformed or otherwise bad IWAD file URLs.

        Now building Eternity from macOS is easier, as the dependencies are
        automatically downloaded.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06.06.2018

BUGFIX: Fixed a problem with the macOS launcher putting IWADs in the PWAD list
        when user is alerted when attempting to start game with no IWAD.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
02.06.2018

BUGFIX: Fixed a regression with portal autoaiming. It would sometimes fail when
        attempting to aim through a sector portal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07.05.2018

FEATURE: Added a CHASEFAST EDF game property flag. Needed to support Raven games
         (Heretic and Hexen) where the monster A_Chase frames are speeded up on
         -fast and skill 5.

         Added the SKILL5FAST prefix flag for non-Decorate frame and framedelta
         definitions, which supports halving the frame time on skill 5 and -fast
         (Doom's demons), same as what Decorate has been having with "fast".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06.05.2018

BUGFIX: ChangeSkill (linedef special) must also update the fast parameters when
        switching to or from nightmare or black plague mode.

        Fixed a lockup caused by having an EDF animation block of different tex-
        ture type than something already defined internally.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
03.05.2018

FEATURE: Added absolute.push and absolute.hop to damagetype. Needed by Heretic's
         powered staff.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
02.05.2018

BUGFIX: The Heretic skills 1 and 5 now multiply the ammo per item correctly.

FEATURE: Added game.skillammomultiplier EDF gameprop specifier to customize this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
01.05.2018

BUGFIX: Fixed a buffer reading runaway when a demo has no marker at the end.
        Thanks to vita for the bug fix.

        Disabled interpolation for polyobjects with portals, until we add inter-
        polation for portal deltas and transforms. It was suffering from
        flickering.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
29.04.2018

BUGFIX: Sounds with "alias" or "random" entries didn't work correctly in sound
        sequences with "playrepeat" and other similar commands.

        Fixed wrong Heretic sound sequences, by adding more gamemode specific
        implementations in EDF.

        Fixed the ceiling movement sound sequence from being cut off on stop.
        This was breaking mods which were replacing DSSTNMOV with something 
        longer, which would only fully play when a ceiling stopped moving.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
28.04.2018

FEATURE: Fixed Heretic pods to act properly. For this, I had to add five new
         thing flags to Eternity, all in the flags4 list:

         1. MONSTERPASS: makes the object pass through monster-blocking lines
            even if it's not a player or friend.

         2. LOWAIMPRIO: object has low autoaim priority, like MBF friends do.
            Useful for destructible props as well.

         3. STICKYCARRY: needed for the weird Heretic pod (and player) specific
            behaviour. Players on top move with the object, and have difficulty
            moving themselves off. They can also be carried upstairs.

         4. SETTARGETONDEATH: target (attacker) is registered even when thing is
            instantly killed on first hit. Normally the target is only changed
            if the thing is alive, but Raven discovered this is not enough for
            pods if they're used in a chain reaction to damage and provoke
            monsters or score frags.

         5. SLIDEOVERTHINGS: emulate Heretic 3D-clipping behaviour where
            non-player things (notably pods) don't stop when falling on other
            things, but instead keep moving until they fall or hit a wall.

         Due to shared behaviour, the HereticPlayer thingtype also has 
         STICKYCARRY.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22.04.2018

BUGFIX: Fixed a long-standing problem with double skies (feature from Hexen) not
        working at all as expected.

        Fixed an off-by-one overflow (otherwise harmless) which caused
        transparent midtextures to show extra black (or index 0) pixels below
        most columns.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19.04.2018

FEATURE: Added hitscan puff type EDF definitions, which is necessary for Heretic
         support. Consideration has also been made for future Hexen and Strife
         in Eternity. The syntax is as follows:

         pufftype <name> [: <base>]
         {
           thingtype       <name>
           sound           <name>
           hitsound        <name>
           hitpufftype     <name>
           nobloodpufftype <name>
           upspeed         <number>
           zspread         <number>
           punchhack       <name>
           particles       <number>
           +|-AlwaysPuff
           +|-Bloodless
           +|-LocalThrust
           +|-RandomTics
         }

         effects.edf files have been added in base/doom and base/heretic.

         Each pufftype defines how a hitscan attack should spawn a thing of a
         given class, with options such as dragonclaw alternate blast, or Strife
         mauler behaviour etc.

IMPROVEMENT: Besides preparing all non-game-specific codepointers for setting
             pufftype, Nailbomb is now fully customizable.

IMPROVEMENT: Fixed the custom spread distribution of FireCustomBullets to be
             triangular, just like the vanilla Doom hitscans.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
09.04.2018

FEATURE: Added the push activation from Hexen. The feature was long advertised
         in ExtraData (and later UDMF) but only now it has been implemented.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
31.03.2018

IMPROVEMENT: Polyobjects are now properly cut off by 1-sided walls, instead of
             their graphics "bleeding" through them when outside the playable
             area.
             
BUGFIX: 2-sided polyobjects now show correctly in Eternity. The back side was
        hidden, which was a regression from vanilla Hexen's polyobjects.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
30.03.2018

FEATURE: Added Polyobj_MoveTo, Polyobj_MoveToSpot, Polyobj_OR_MoveTo and
         Polyobj_OR_MoveToSpot, based on the GZDoom extensions.

BUGFIX: Fixed the weird texture glitches happening with multiple polyobjects in 
        a sector, some stationary and some moving.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
26.03.2018

FEATURE: Incosistent linked portals between separate sector islands are now
         supported! This means you can now place "wormholes" in the map without
         getting errors! The link offsets are updated dynamically in order to 
         provide a gameplay as good as possible.
         
         There is still a restriction left: do not place portals between two
         areas already interconnected by sectors. That would still error out.
         
BUGFIX: Concealed sector portals were previously missed by the blockmap, 
        resulting in buggy behaviour when clipping against things inside some
        through-portal elevators.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
23.03.2018

IMPROVEMENT: Polyobject movement is now interpolated, though moving portals not
             so yet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21.03.2018

IMPROVEMENT: Weapon sprite motion is now interpolated (smooth).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19.03.2018

FEATURE: Polyobjects with portals no longer require their origin box to be
         connected to sectors from the spawn spot's layer.
         
         Did this by marking the box sector as a "neighbour" of the spawn spot
         sector, for the P_GatherSector function.
         
FEATURE: Visual portals on polyobjects now rotate along with the poly.

BUGFIX: Fixed polyobjects not setting up their linedefs' sound origins correctly
        at spawn.

BUGFIX: Fixed two-way non-interactive portals generated by Line_QuickPortal or
        Portal_Define on one-sided linedefs not showing the upper and lower
        textures, unlike the linked portals.

==================================
Since v3.42.03 "Heimdal" release 2
==================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14.03.2018

BUGFIX: Fixed an oversight where the ExtraData-assigned specials weren't
        assigned to the front sidedef's "special" entry, which is a shortcut
        made by Lee Killough to store information about translucent walls or
        colourmaps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12.03.2018

BUGFIX: Fixed sky hack linedefs from showing up when any of the sectors has a
        heightsec (Boom transfer-heights target) different from the other. This
        problem reportedly doesn't occur other Boom-based ports.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
03.03.2018

FEATURE: Polyobjects now accept clusters of portals inside them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
28.02.2018

FEATURE: configurable air control and friction. This is so the player can move
         in mid-air better than what's possible under Hexen or Strife.

         It's set in EMAPINFO by setting the "aircontrol" and "airfriction"
         properties.

         AirControl defaults to 0, which is like in Doom or Hexen,
         depending on whether the comp_aircontrol flag is set. Full control is
         set by 65536.

         AirFriction was added by Altazimuth because it's useful
         if air control is high enough, to prevent the player from reaching
         extreme velocity. Default value is 0, like in the normal game. Maximum
         value is 65535.

         Also added two ACS functions for this: SetAirControl(fixed) and 
         SetAirFriction(fixed), the latter which is an external function, desig-
         nated by index 302.

BUGFIX: Gravity is now stored in save games, as well as air control and
        friction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
25.02.2018

FEATURE: comp_zombie, comp_infcheat, comp_vile, comp_skull, comp_god and 
         comp_skymap are now "YES" by default, because they're either more
         useful in common megawads, or are related to cheating.

BUGFIX: PNAMES is now properly bounds-checked, instead of tolerating buffer
        overflows.

        Also fixed various macOS compilation issues or situations detected by
        the compiler used there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
02.01.2018

BUGFIX: various demo playback fixes, including proper -solo-net playback or
        better crushing stair emulation (which can't be 100% done however, due
        to undefined behaviour in vanilla Doom).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
23.12.2017

FEATURE: the demo-test facility is now available in official builds. Made major
         fixes before merging it to master.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.11.2017

BUGFIX: fixed fullscreen mode on macOS to always use the SDL-desktop mode,
        because true fullscreen is pretty broken and doesn't abide by the human
        interface design guidelines, which require allowing the user to switch
        out of the game using mission control. Also changed the Cmd+Ctrl+F full-
        screen command with Cmd+F, because ctrl can be bound to player actions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
30.10.2017

FEATURE: Added FRIENDFOEMISSILE thing type flag, which will make projectiles
         shot by friends harm enemies of the same species, and viceversa.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
28.10.2017

FEATURE: Monster infighting can now be customized. Several EDF features have
         been added. Make sure to update the "base" folder now. If a development
         build has no "base" folder, it's broken! "Doom/things.edf" has been
         updated with a new entry.

         1. First feature is the new "thinggroup" EDF block. It has the following
         structure (as usual, replace all <> enclosed text with your text):

         thinggroup <name>
         {
           flags <flags>
           types { <thingtype1>, <thingtype2>, ... }
         }

         A group has a list of thingtype mnemonics in "types". The "flags" are
         the following:

         * PROJECTILEALLIANCE: monsters in the list won't harm each other with
           their projectiles. This generalizes the Doom 2 baron of hell / hell
           knight alliance. They may still be harmed by other kinds of damage
           (explosions, bullets etc.) and react to it. To prevent that kind of
           damage, use "damagefactor <x>, immune" on thingtype (see new feature
           below).

         * DAMAGEIGNORE: monsters in the list may be damaged by each other, but
           will not infight as a result. This generalizes the deprecated
           BOSSIGNORE thingtype flag. It will NOT prevent monsters from infighting
           others of the SAME species; for that, use a new thingtype
           flag (see below).

         * INHERITED: only has meaning if any of the other flags above is set.
           It makes it so any thingtypes inheriting the ones from the list are
           also included in the group. By default they don't inherit.

         Note: they don't have to be monsters specifically, any thingtype will do.

         Currently the "name" is merely descriptive but must be unique per
         thinggroup.

         Example: the following EDF makes imps and cacodemons immune to each
         other's attacks:

           thinggroup ClassicDevils	// name can be anything but must be unique
           {
             flags ProjectileAlliance
             types { DoomImp, Cacodemon }
           }
           // EXAMPLE END

         2. New thingtype "damagefactor" attribute: "immune". Unlike
         "damagefactor <X>, 0", this one also prevents pain, thrusting and
         retaliation. Useful to prevent friendly fire and infighting for arbitrary
         damage types (means of death / MODs) between monsters.

         Example: this makes zombiemen immune to their own attacks:

           thingdelta
           {
             name Zombieman

             mod ZombiemanMOD      // their default MOD is "unknown"; it needs to
                                   // be set to a custom one.
             damagefactor ZombiemanMOD, immune
           }

           // MOD definition (use a number that doesn't conflict with the stock
           // ones):
           damagetype ZombiemanMOD { num 100 }
           // EXAMPLE END

         3. New thingtype flags:

         * NOSPECIESINFIGHT: this one prevents monsters of the same species from
           hating each other, even if they harm each other with friendly fire.
           This flag is needed because the aforementioned thinggroup
           DAMAGEIGNORE flag only has effect between monsters of different
           species (that is a limitation inherited from the deprecated EDF
           BOSSIGNORE thingtype flag).

         * HARMSPECIESMISSILE: this one allows monsters of the same species to
           be affected by each other's projectiles, overriding the default
           immunity from classic Doom.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15.10.2017

FEATURE: Added a "Show Eternity Log" menu option in the macOS start-up dialog
         box. Something like this was long overdue and necessary to read any
         load-time warning that occurred without Eternity quitting with error.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.10.2017

BUGFIX: Hopefully fixed an insidious optimization bug (that only occurs in
        release builds) that would make realloc() lock up Eternity if new fields
        are added to ticcmd_t (very likely to happen when inventory is added)
        and a demo is recorded. First sign of error was right in the code,
        because the Boom team didn't bother to properly put sizeof(), putting a
        hard-coded number instead. But even after replacing that with sizeof(),
        followed by a small margin, the game would still lock up! So to be safe,
        I doubled that buffer size.
        
        Problem is that I don't know why that happens; what could be optimized...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08.10.2017

FEATURE: Added "ee_compat = true" global field in UDMF. This makes Eternity
         treat any other namespace the same as "eternity", and may be used by
         editors to save UDMF wads with features common Eternity and other ports
         (like GZDoom).
         
         Thanks to anotak for implementing and submitting it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06.10.2017

FEATURE: Added EDF animation and switch definitions. Added ANIMDEFS support --
         a subset with what Eternity supports.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06.09.2017

BUGFIX: Fixed looping problems in non-conventional linked portal maps, where
        autoaim would lock up the game because the sector portals were spotted
        outside the intended sector, and sprite projections would slow down to
        a crawl because the loop protection was too big (so I reduced that).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
05.09.2017

BUGFIX: Fixed a problem with polyobject portals failing to capture things,
        especially those placed at their spawn point. Now they also capture
        things if they have moving pits.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
03.09.2017

FEATURE: Added EDF thingtype tranmap. Works like the Boom linedef special.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18.08.2017

FEATURE: Hexen's vanilla ANIMDEFS lump is now supported.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17.08.2017

WORKAROUND: Removed sprite projections from moving wall portals for the time
            being. The phantom sprites were trailing behind, ruining the view.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16.08.2017

BUGFIX: The sector portal seg rejector still had issues. Added easy checks when
        the bounding box is entirely in front or at the back of the checked seg.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
09.08.2017

FEATURE: -vanilla is now stored in savegames, which means that you can now
         preserve vanilla-compatible campaigns.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07.08.2017

BUGFIX: The Heretic AUTOPAGE background wasn't moving along with the map. Fixed.
        Now it moves at the same speed, without the displacement from vanilla
        Heretic.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06.08.2017

BUGFIX: Fixed case sensitive parsing of DECORATE state "stop" keyword, causing
        Eternity to crash if it was expressed in other ways, such as "Stop".

========================
Since v3.42.02 "Heimdal"
========================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
31.07.2017

BUGFIX: Demos recorded with MBF or less compatibility level in ports such as
        PrBoom+ now ignore EMAPINFO when loaded in Eternity. This fixes some E1
        Valiant megawad demos from the Doomed Speed Demo Archive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
30.07.2017

FEATURE: new EMAPINFO field, inter-levelname. The only way so far to set the in-
         termission level name has been through levelpic. Also fixed the broken
         handling of "entering next level" behaviour in the score intermission
         screen.

         UMAPINFO support has also started (UMAPINFO is a proposed map-info
         format which may also appear in PrBoom+, and Eternity will read it be-
         fore reading EMAPINFO).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19.07.2017

BUGFIX: fixed seg rejection problems with anchored portals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15.07.2017

BUGFIX: multiline UDMF comments were pretty much broken. It was lucky that the
        editors don't generate such comments.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
04.07.2017

BUGFIX: linked portals were getting overflows when they were crossing a line of
        constant X or constant Y of +/-16384, because of the average calculation
        not being safe for int32. This caused portal maps to fail and act
        strangely unless they were moved around in the editor, but not too much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
25.06.2017

BUGFIX: fixed a crash happening at map startup when linked portals had an error
        and the map also had polyobject linked portals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
26.05.2017

FEATURE: linked portals can now move together with the sector surfaces. Use the
         UDMF portal_ceil_attached or portal_floor_attached boolean sector
         properties for this, or the ExtraData ATTACHEDPORTAL portalflag.

         Added because of proposed scenarios in mods, such as vertically moving
         platforms.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14.05.2017

BUGFIX: comp_planeshoot was wrongly preventing gunfire specials from being
        activated when crossed (not impacted) by hitscans.
